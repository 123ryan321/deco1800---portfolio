	<h1>Course Reflection</h1>
	<p>Although I am studying electrical engineering and mathematics I choose to complete Deco1800 as an elective because web design and development appealed to me and is a valuable skill set I wished to learn. 
	This is something I have never done and therefore believed it would be challenging at times but rewarding and interesting. The course definitely lived up to this I thoroughly enjoyed learning web development and design. I am not very artistic so I did need to do quite a bit of research to get design ideas but I believe my projects all turned out well. </p>

	<p>The main project was enjoyable as you worked in a team and you could collaborate and easily receive feedback on your work. Team projects especially at university can be sometimes hard to manage, it is sometimes hard to get everyone to work and communicate, however my team was great. We had no problems and I believe that we operated better with three people and can not see the need for a fourth member. With three team members it was easy to distribute the tasks evenly and easier to get everyone together for a meeting. </p>

	<p>The portfolio task was also enjoyable, throughout the main project I completed functionality for the game and therefore concentrated on javascript. By completing the portfolio individually I was able to improve my skills in html and css. I also managed to do the styling & design of the website which at the start of the semester I knew would be my biggest challenge. Furthermore it was interesting to do the portfolio because it catered for a different audience, while the main project was for children and was very bright and visual, the portfolio I designed is clean and crisp. </p>

	<p>The blogs, to be honest I did not enjoy, these were time consuming and I don't believe helped my learning greatly. They did however help when it came to producing the portfolio as they stored a collection of images and reminded me of work that had been done.</p>

	<p>Although overall I enjoyed this course and learnt a lot about web development there were a few aspects I would change. The first is the course may have been slow to start; the first few weeks we were just completing photshop tasks I would of much prefered to have the project started and working on that earlier. Additionally the progress report of the project required task breakdown, plan and delegation. These tasks although not submitted were completed by my team and I for concept milestone. After all how do you start without a plan? I think it would be better to move those specifications to the concept milestone and then possibly require a revised version for the progress milestone. </p>

	<p>The other aspect I would change is the compulsory workshop and contact hours. As I mentioned before the first few weeks I didn't believe we did too much work and this was four hours a week I could have been completing and another subject such as my thesis. It was much better however as the semester went out and I had completed and had questions about my projects, these hourse definitely help for that but I would come to those hours compulsory or not if I needed help, but in the weeks I did not need help I had to sit there working on another subject. </p>

	<p>Other than these petty aspects the course was interesting and education I am glad that I completed it and have now learnt some valuable skills.</p>
