		<h1>About me</h1>

		<p>I am an Electrical Engineering and Mathematics student studying at the University of Queensland. It is safe to say web design and development are not my forte, but the best way to learn is by doing.
		This is in fact the first web page I have developed and it was apart of a University course  I completed in Semester 2, 2015.</p>

		<img id = "aboutIMG" src="images/about.jpg">

		<p>Although I have never previously designed and built a web page I am familiar with programming and coding techniques. I wouldn't say I am amazing in any language but I can dabble in Java, C, C++, Python, MATLAB and now html, css and javascript.</p>

		<p>I am finishing my degree this year and have thoroughly enjoyed the challenging past 5 years. My most interesting and rewarding project would have to be my thesis for which I created an Autonomous Air Hockey Robot.</p>

		<p>Although university work consumes the majority of my time, I enjoy almost anything outdoors. I am a fairly active person and love all sports. </p>
